      <pre># MODULE 6: Your First Automation
## *Hello, OpenClaw. Let's Do Something Actually Useful.*

&gt; 🧠 **Brain Cells at stake:** 300 base + up to 120 bonus (quiz)  
&gt; ⏱️ **Estimated time:** ~90 minutes (hands-on)  
&gt; 🎯 **Unlock:** Requires Module 5 completion with gateway running

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, Graham will be able to:
- [ ] Have a real conversation with his OpenClaw instance
- [ ] Set up a basic HEARTBEAT.md with 3 automated checks
- [ ] Create his first cron job (scheduled task)
- [ ] Verify automations are running correctly
- [ ] Know how to edit the magic files safely
- [ ] Feel the genuine satisfaction of seeing "it actually worked"

---

### Key Concepts to Cover

**1. Your first conversation**
Open Telegram, message your bot:
- "What's today's date?"
- "Summarize what you know about yourself"  
- "Tell me a joke about marketing"

This isn't fluff — it's verifying the connection works and the AI has personality.

**2. Setting up HEARTBEAT.md for the first time**
Edit `~/.openclaw/workspace/HEARTBEAT.md`:
```markdown
# Graham's Heartbeat Checklist

- Good morning check: if it's between 8am-9am, send me a brief morning greeting
- If more than 12 hours since last message, send a check-in
- Check if any cron jobs have finished recently — if yes, report summary
```

After saving, the AI picks this up on the next 30-minute cycle.

**3. Creating a first cron job: the Weekly Recap**
```bash
openclaw cron add \
  --name "Monday Morning Brief" \
  --cron "0 8 * * 1" \
  --tz "Asia/Bangkok" \
  --session isolated \
  --message "It's Monday morning. Give Graham a brief motivational note and remind him to check his lead pipeline." \
  --announce \
  --channel telegram
```

This will run every Monday at 8am Bangkok time and send Graham a message. Change timezone to match his location.

**4. Verifying everything works**
```bash
openclaw cron list          # See all scheduled jobs
openclaw cron run &lt;job-id&gt;  # Force-run a job immediately to test it
openclaw gateway status      # Confirm gateway is healthy
```

**5. The magic file edit workflow (safe)**
1. Open the file in any text editor (Notepad, VS Code, TextEdit on Mac)
2. Make changes
3. Save
4. The gateway picks up changes on the next session/heartbeat (no restart needed for workspace files)
5. Test with a message: "What does your HEARTBEAT.md say?" — AI will confirm it read the update

### Quiz — Module 6
**Complete for up to 120 bonus Brain Cells (24 per correct answer)**

**Q1:** Graham set up a cron job for Monday mornings but it didn't run. What's the most likely issue?  
✅ **Answer (any of):** Timezone mismatch (UTC vs local time); Gateway not running; Job is disabled; Cron expression is wrong. Solution: `openclaw cron list` to check status, `openclaw cron run &lt;id&gt;` to force-test.

**Q2:** How does OpenClaw "pick up" changes to HEARTBEAT.md?  
✅ **Answer:** On the next heartbeat cycle (default: ~30 minutes), the agent reads the current version of HEARTBEAT.md. Changes take effect automatically without restarting the gateway.

**Q3:** What's the difference between a "main session" cron job and an "isolated session" cron job?  
✅ **Answer:** Main session = runs in the same context as your regular conversations (sees history). Isolated = starts fresh each time (no prior context, can use different model, announces summary).

**Q4:** Graham sends his OpenClaw bot "What's on my heartbeat checklist?" and gets a blank response. What might be wrong?  
✅ **Answer:** HEARTBEAT.md might be empty, the gateway might not have read it yet, or the AI may need to be prompted more specifically. Try asking: "Please read your HEARTBEAT.md file and tell me what it contains."

**Q5:** What command lists all of Graham's current cron jobs?  
✅ **Answer:** `openclaw cron list`

---

### 🔓 Unlock Criteria for Module 7
- HEARTBEAT.md configured with at least 2 items AND
- At least 1 cron job created AND
- Successfully sent and received at least 5 messages with OpenClaw
- **Achievement Unlock:** "First Automation Live" 🤖 (+30 bonus Brain Cells)
- **Streak bonus:** Complete Module 5 → 6 in same week = +50 Brain Cells

---

### Humor Notes for Module 6
- The "tell me a joke about marketing" test message is deliberately fun — normalize enjoying the AI
- The first working automation is a dopamine hit — the module should BUILD to it and celebrate it
- "The Magic File Edit Workflow (safe)" should be presented with appropriate gravitas — this is where people mess up
- Consider: "Congratulations. You just automated your life a little bit. This feeling only gets better."

        <strong>Drama Break</strong>
        <pre>## The Great Debate (Module 6 → 7 interlude)

**"Exciting superpower or privacy nightmare?"**

The internet is split. Not about whether OpenClaw works — it clearly does — but about whether giving an AI agent access to your computer is a good idea.

**Team Superpower:**
&gt; *"I haven't done manual work in 6 months."*
&gt; *"A smart model with eyes and hands at a desk. You message it like a coworker."* — @nathanclark_
&gt; *"The first time I've felt like I'm living in the future since ChatGPT launched."* — @davemorin

**Team Concern:**
&gt; *"You're giving an AI agent root access to your computer and a direct line to your WhatsApp. What could possibly go wrong?"*
&gt; *"The ClawHavoc campaign proved what happens when you trust a skill registry."*

**The self-hosted argument:**
OpenClaw's founding principle is that your data never leaves your machine. Unlike Zapier (cloud), Make (cloud), or Claude.ai (cloud), OpenClaw runs locally. Your messages, your files, your automations — all on your hardware.

The catch: that only holds if the skills you install are clean. Which brings us back to skill verification.

**Regulatory watch:**
The EU is actively working on AI agent regulations. The US watching. The question "who is responsible when an AI agent sends an email you didn't authorize?" is becoming a real legal question.

Graham's takeaway: OpenClaw's self-hosted model is genuinely more private than every alternative. The security risks are real but manageable with good hygiene. Welcome to the frontier.
