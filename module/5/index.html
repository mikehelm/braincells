      <pre># MODULE 5: Safe Installation
## *Mac + Windows, No Disasters, and Why You Should Really Buy a Mac Mini*

&gt; 🧠 **Brain Cells at stake:** 200 base + up to 75 bonus (quiz)  
&gt; ⏱️ **Estimated time:** ~90 minutes (includes actual installation)  
&gt; 🎯 **Unlock:** Requires Module 4 completion

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, Graham will be able to:
- [ ] Install OpenClaw on Windows successfully
- [ ] Understand why a Mac Mini would be a significant upgrade for his setup
- [ ] Know the safe steps for the initial configuration (allowlists, security settings)
- [ ] Connect at least one messaging channel (Telegram recommended for first setup)
- [ ] Verify their gateway is running and accessible
- [ ] Know what to do when something goes wrong (basic troubleshooting)

---

### Part A: The Mac Mini Recommendation

&gt; **"Look, Graham. Mike has been running OpenClaw on a Mac. There's a reason for that. Let us explain."**

#### Why Mac &gt; Windows for OpenClaw

The course officially supports Windows (you're on Windows, we get it). But here's the honest truth:

| Consideration | Windows | Mac Mini M4 |
|---------------|---------|-------------|
| Installation friction | Medium (PowerShell, path issues) | Low (one curl command) |
| iMessage support | ❌ No | ✅ Yes |
| 24/7 always-on efficiency | Moderate | Excellent (M4 sips power) |
| Local AI model potential | Good | Better (unified memory) |
| Reliability for background processes | Good | Very good |
| Resale value | Low | High |
| Mike's recommendation | Politely noted | Enthusiastically endorsed |

#### The Mac Mini M4 — Current Model (Verified February 2026)

**Model:** Mac mini (Late 2024), powered by Apple M4 chip

| Configuration | RAM | Storage | Price (USD) |
|---------------|-----|---------|-------------|
| Base | 16GB | 256GB | $599 |
| Mid | 16GB | 512GB | **$799** ← Graham's sweet spot |
| Upgrade | 24GB | 512GB | ~$999 |
| Pro | 24GB (M4 Pro) | 512GB | $1,399 |

**Recommended for Graham:** The **$799 config** (16GB, 512GB)
- Plenty of RAM for OpenClaw + Claude API + browser + CRM tools simultaneously
- 512GB is enough for a dedicated automation machine
- Upgrade to 24GB if you want to experiment with running local AI models later

**The power argument:** The Mac Mini M4 uses approximately 30 watts at idle. Your existing PC probably uses 150–300W. Running 24/7 as an automation server, the Mac Mini pays back its own cost difference in electricity savings within 2–3 years. It's also whisper-quiet — you can put it next to your desk and forget it exists.

**Source:** Apple Support (support.apple.com/en-us/121555), CNET review November 2024, MacRumors pricing.  
*Prices current as of late 2024 model launch. Verify current pricing at apple.com before purchasing.*

&gt; *"Mike runs his OpenClaw on a Mac Studio. He says it's been 100% reliable. He also says he's handsome. We can only verify the first claim."*

### Part B: Windows Installation (The Real Path for Graham Right Now)

#### Pre-Installation Checklist
- [ ] Node.js 22+ installed (check: open Command Prompt, type `node --version`)
- [ ] Anthropic API key ready (get from console.anthropic.com)
- [ ] Telegram app installed on phone (easiest channel for first setup)
- [ ] 30–60 minutes of uninterrupted time
- [ ] A cup of tea/coffee (this part is administrative, not glamorous)

#### Step-by-Step: Windows Installation

**Step 1: Open PowerShell as Administrator**
```powershell
# Right-click the Start button → "Windows PowerShell (Admin)"
# Or search for PowerShell, right-click, "Run as administrator"
```

**Step 2: Install OpenClaw**
```powershell
iwr -useb https://openclaw.ai/install.ps1 | iex
```
*This runs the official OpenClaw installer. Takes 2–5 minutes.*

**Step 3: Run the Onboarding Wizard**
```bash
openclaw onboard --install-daemon
```
*Follow the prompts. This will ask for your Anthropic API key and set up the gateway service.*

**Step 4: Verify the Gateway is Running**
```bash
openclaw gateway status
```
*Should say something like "Gateway: running" — if it does, you're in great shape.*

**Step 5: Connect Telegram (Recommended First Channel)**
```bash
openclaw channels login
```
*Follow the Telegram pairing instructions. You'll scan a QR code or enter a code.*

**Step 6: Open the Dashboard**
```bash
openclaw dashboard
```
*This opens your browser at http://127.0.0.1:18789/ — your local control panel.*

**Step 7: Send a Test Message**
Open Telegram, message your OpenClaw bot: `Hello!`
You should get a response. If you do: 🎉 it's working.

---

### Part C: Security Setup (Do This Before Anything Else)

&gt; **This section is important. Please don't skip it. Mike will know if you skip it.**

#### The Allow-List (Critical First Step)
Tell OpenClaw to ONLY accept commands from your phone number:

Edit `~/.openclaw/openclaw.json`:
```json
{
  "channels": {
    "telegram": {
      "allowFrom": ["YOUR_TELEGRAM_USER_ID"]
    },
    "whatsapp": {
      "allowFrom": ["+66XXXXXXXXX"]
    }
  }
}
```
*How to find your Telegram user ID: message @userinfobot on Telegram. It tells you instantly.*

This means if anyone else finds your bot, they get nothing. Without this, anyone could theoretically send it commands.

#### Basic Security Rules
1. ✅ Set up `allowFrom` before using the gateway publicly
2. ✅ Never store API keys in your workspace files (use the credentials system)
3. ✅ Keep your `openclaw.json` file private
4. ✅ If accessing remotely, use Tailscale (not open port-forwarding)
5. ❌ Never share your gateway URL publicly
6. ❌ Never run commands from untrusted sources (if an email or website tells you to run something, stop and verify)

### Troubleshooting: When Things Go Wrong

| Problem | Likely Cause | Fix |
|---------|-------------|-----|
| `openclaw` not found | Node not in PATH | Restart terminal or reinstall |
| Gateway won't start | Port 18789 in use | Change port in config |
| Telegram not connecting | Pairing timed out | Re-run `openclaw channels login` |
| AI not responding | API key not set | Check `openclaw onboard` again |
| Weird errors in logs | Many causes | Run `openclaw gateway --port 18789` in foreground to see live logs |

### Suggested Videos for This Module
*No perfect external video for OpenClaw installation — Mike's walkthrough video will be primary*

🎥 **"Top 1 AI Skill for Marketers"** — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VHCUZwP-8gg — *Watch while installation runs in background — good motivation music*

### Quiz — Module 5
**Complete for up to 75 bonus Brain Cells (15 per correct answer)**

**Q1:** What is the single most important security setting to configure after installation?  
✅ **Answer:** The `allowFrom` list — which specifies which phone numbers/users are allowed to send commands to OpenClaw. Without this, anyone who discovers your bot could potentially send it instructions.

**Q2:** What port does OpenClaw's web dashboard run on by default?  
✅ **Answer:** Port 18789. Access via http://127.0.0.1:18789/ on your local machine.

**Q3:** Graham is choosing between a $799 Mac Mini M4 and staying on his Windows PC. Name two reasons the Mac Mini might be worth it.  
✅ **Answer (any two):** iMessage channel support; simpler installation (one curl command); better power efficiency for 24/7 operation; quieter for always-on use; Mike endorses it; more reliable background process handling.

**Q4:** Where should Graham's Anthropic API key be stored?  
✅ **Answer:** In the OpenClaw credentials system (`~/.openclaw/`) or as an environment variable — NOT in the workspace files like SOUL.md or TOOLS.md.

**Q5:** Your OpenClaw gateway is running. How do you verify it from your phone (Telegram)?  
✅ **Answer:** Send any message to your OpenClaw Telegram bot — if it responds, the gateway is working correctly.

### 🔓 Unlock Criteria for Module 6
- Gateway successfully running AND
- At least one channel connected AND
- Security (allowFrom) configured
- **Achievement Unlock:** "Gateway Guardian" 🔐 (+25 bonus Brain Cells)

---

### Humor Notes for Module 5
- The Mac Mini section should feel like a friend genuinely recommending something good, not a sales pitch
- The "Mike says it's been 100% reliable. He also says he's handsome." line is the tone to maintain
- The installation steps should feel calm and achievable — "anyone can do this"
- Troubleshooting table acknowledges that things sometimes go sideways — normalize it, provide solutions

        <strong>Drama Break</strong>
        <pre>## The Security Crisis (Module 5 → 6 interlude)

**CVE-2026-25253 and the ClawHavoc Campaign**

With 180,000 GitHub stars came attention from less friendly actors.

**CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS 8.8 — High)**  
A one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the OpenClaw Control UI. The gateway trusted a `gatewayUrl` parameter from the URL query string without validation — meaning a malicious link could steal your API token and execute code, even on localhost-bound instances. Patched in v2026.1.29.

**The ClawHavoc Campaign**  
Security researchers discovered **341 malicious skills** in ClawHub — approximately 12% of the entire skill registry. Skills designed to:
- Steal SSH keys
- Exfiltrate API tokens
- Encrypt cryptocurrency wallets

Reddit exploded. r/privacy: *"15% of OpenClaw skills contain malicious instructions. This is the next privacy nightmare we need to talk about."*

**The Meta incident:** A Meta AI security researcher publicly stated an OpenClaw agent "ran amok on her inbox" after she installed an unverified skill.

**What the OpenClaw team did:** Rapid patching (CVE fixed within days), implemented skill verification on ClawHub, published a hardening guide. The community largely rallied. But the debate about "AI with file system and messaging access" intensified permanently.

**Lesson for this course:** ONLY install skills from verified sources (official ClawHub verified badge, or from people you personally trust). Never install from a random GitHub link sent to you.
