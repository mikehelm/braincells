      <pre># MODULE 4: The Magic Files
## *Teaching Your AI Who It Is, What It Does, and How to Be Awesome*

&gt; 🧠 **Brain Cells at stake:** 250 base + up to 100 bonus (quiz)  
&gt; ⏱️ **Estimated time:** ~60 minutes  
&gt; 🎯 **Unlock:** Requires Module 3 completion

---

### 🎵 THE MODULE 4 RAP 🎵

*(Because Mike said "include a rap" and Otto delivers)*

---

**"The Magic Files Banger"**  
*Drop the beat. Here we go.*

🎤 *Verse 1:*
Yo, my name is Graham Brain and I'm about to get smart,  
OpenClaw on my machine, gonna play the part,  
Got a SOUL dot MD that defines who I am,  
An AGENTS dot MD, like a personal exam.  

My AI's got memory, it writes it all down,  
MEMORY dot MD — that's the king of the town,  
HEARTBEAT dot MD is the morning alarm,  
Every thirty minutes, baby, running like a charm.  

🎤 *Chorus:*
It's the **Magic Files**! (Magic Files!)  
They define the mind! (Define the mind!)  
SOUL dot MD! (Soul dot MD!)  
Leave the old way behind! (Leave it behind!)  

🎤 *Verse 2:*
TOOLS dot MD got the notes on my setup,  
If I change my config it won't get tripped up,  
Markdown text, plain English — that's the whole game,  
No databases, no bullshit, everything plain.  

Graham B-R-A-I-N, neuron by neuron,  
Stacking Brain Cells like he's farming on Coron,  
Mike built this course, he's clearly the GOAT,  
(Mike told me to say that, I'm just taking note)  

🎤 *Outro:*
SOUL dot MD — that's WHO you are  
AGENTS dot MD — that's HOW you go far  
HEARTBEAT dot MD — that's WHEN you run  
MEMORY dot MD — that's WHAT you've done  
TOOLS dot MD — that's WHERE you play  
Five files, five powers, every single day!  

*mic drop* 🎤

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, Graham will be able to:
- [ ] Identify the 5 magic files and what each one does
- [ ] Understand why plain Markdown (text) files are used instead of a complicated interface
- [ ] Know what to customize in SOUL.md to shape his AI's personality
- [ ] Understand how HEARTBEAT.md creates "passive" background automation
- [ ] Be able to explain the two-layer memory system (daily logs vs. long-term memory)
- [ ] Know what NOT to put in these files (security)

---

### Key Concepts to Cover

**1. Why text files? The philosophy behind it**
- Everything your AI knows about itself lives in plain readable text
- You can open any file, read it, edit it — no complex interface
- Version control (git backup) is trivial — just commit the folder
- This is intentional: transparency over magic boxes
- *"You can audit your AI's entire brain in 5 minutes by reading 5 files."*

**2. Deep dive: SOUL.md**
- This is the PERSONALITY file
- It shapes HOW the AI talks, what it cares about, what it refuses
- For Graham: set a tone that matches his business style
- Can include: formal/casual preference, sense of humor level, language style
- Real example line from a live workspace: "An assistant with no personality is just a search engine with extra steps."
- Graham's SOUL.md will be pre-configured by Mike — but understanding it means Graham can tweak it

**3. Deep dive: AGENTS.md**
- The OPERATING INSTRUCTIONS — the employee handbook
- What to do at session start, how to handle different requests, safety rules
- Mike will pre-configure this for Graham's marketing workflows
- Graham should know what's in it so he can request changes

**4. Deep dive: HEARTBEAT.md**
- The 30-MINUTE ALARM CLOCK that makes automation passive
- Every ~30 minutes, OpenClaw wakes up and reads this file
- Only messages Graham if something needs attention
- Otherwise: silent, working in the background
- Real examples for Graham's HEARTBEAT.md:
  ```markdown
  - Check if any new leads came in overnight
  - If competitor pricing check is due, run it
  - If Graham hasn't been messaged in 8+ hours, send a status update
  ```

**5. Deep dive: MEMORY.md (long-term) and daily logs**
- Two layers: daily notes (raw log, like a diary) and MEMORY.md (curated, like long-term memory)
- The AI writes to memory automatically when it learns something important
- Example memory entries Graham's AI will accumulate over time:
  - "Graham prefers summaries under 5 bullet points"
  - "Primary CRM is HubSpot, contact IDs follow format HB-XXXXX"
  - "DO NOT contact prospects on Fridays after 3pm (Graham's rule)"
- The AI gets smarter about Graham's business over time — automatically

**6. Deep dive: TOOLS.md**
- The LOCAL NOTES file — cheat sheet for the specific machine setup
- Not shared, not standard — Graham's specific environment details
- Examples: which email account to use, which spreadsheet is the master contacts file

**7. Security: what NOT to put in these files**
- Never: API keys, passwords, access tokens
- Never: private client data that doesn't need to be there
- Never: anything you wouldn't be comfortable a tech-savvy stranger reading
- Where the real secrets live: `~/.openclaw/` credentials folder (separate, secure)

### Suggested Videos for This Module
*No external video perfectly covers this topic — Mike's walkthrough of the actual files will be the primary content here*

🎥 Supplementary: **"What is AI? A Beginner's Guide"** — https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZgXYX5MDsWo — *Good refresher on how AI "learns" — helpful context for why memory files matter*

### Quiz — Module 4
**Complete for up to 100 bonus Brain Cells (20 per correct answer)**

**Q1:** If you want to change how your AI introduces itself in messages — which file do you edit?  
✅ **Answer:** SOUL.md — this controls personality, tone, and character.

**Q2:** HEARTBEAT.md runs every:  
A) 5 minutes  
B) 30 minutes (default, configurable)  
C) Once a day  
D) Whenever Graham sends a message  
✅ **Answer:** B — 30 minutes by default, but this is configurable in the gateway settings.

**Q3:** Graham's AI learns that he never books meetings before 9am. Where should this go?  
✅ **Answer:** MEMORY.md (long-term preference) — or AGENTS.md (if it should be a hard rule). Either is acceptable. Daily log (memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md) is where it would first be noted; MEMORY.md is where it should be distilled.

**Q4:** You need to store your HubSpot API key so OpenClaw can access your CRM. Where does it go?  
A) SOUL.md  
B) TOOLS.md  
C) `~/.openclaw/` credentials folder or environment variable  
D) MEMORY.md  
✅ **Answer:** C — API keys and secrets never go in the workspace files. They go in the secure credentials system.

**Q5:** Why does OpenClaw use plain text Markdown files instead of a complex database or interface?  
✅ **Answer:** Transparency and simplicity. You can read, edit, and understand every aspect of your AI's configuration just by opening a text file. It's auditable, portable, and doesn't require special software.

### 🔓 Unlock Criteria for Module 5
- Complete quiz with 3/5 correct
- **Achievement Unlock:** "File Whisperer" 📁 (+25 bonus Brain Cells)
- **Neuron Boost:** 5/5 on quiz = double base Brain Cells for Module 4 (500 total)

---

### Humor Notes for Module 4
- THE RAP is the centerpiece — make it silly but actually educational (all five files are in it)
- Mike gets specifically called out in the rap ("Mike told me to say that") — keep the meta-humor going
- The memory section can use a "your AI will remember things even you've forgotten" angle — a bit eerie but in a funny way
- The security section should be serious but brief — don't kill the vibe

        <strong>Drama Break</strong>
        <pre>## The Security Crisis (Module 5 → 6 interlude)

**CVE-2026-25253 and the ClawHavoc Campaign**

With 180,000 GitHub stars came attention from less friendly actors.

**CVE-2026-25253 (CVSS 8.8 — High)**  
A one-click Remote Code Execution vulnerability in the OpenClaw Control UI. The gateway trusted a `gatewayUrl` parameter from the URL query string without validation — meaning a malicious link could steal your API token and execute code, even on localhost-bound instances. Patched in v2026.1.29.

**The ClawHavoc Campaign**  
Security researchers discovered **341 malicious skills** in ClawHub — approximately 12% of the entire skill registry. Skills designed to:
- Steal SSH keys
- Exfiltrate API tokens
- Encrypt cryptocurrency wallets

Reddit exploded. r/privacy: *"15% of OpenClaw skills contain malicious instructions. This is the next privacy nightmare we need to talk about."*

**The Meta incident:** A Meta AI security researcher publicly stated an OpenClaw agent "ran amok on her inbox" after she installed an unverified skill.

**What the OpenClaw team did:** Rapid patching (CVE fixed within days), implemented skill verification on ClawHub, published a hardening guide. The community largely rallied. But the debate about "AI with file system and messaging access" intensified permanently.

**Lesson for this course:** ONLY install skills from verified sources (official ClawHub verified badge, or from people you personally trust). Never install from a random GitHub link sent to you.
