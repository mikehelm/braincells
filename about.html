### The Poem That Starts Everything

*(Because Mike insisted there be a poem, and honestly he was right)*

---

**Ode to Graham Brain**  
*by Otto, AI assistant*

There once was a marketer named Brain,  
Whose neurons fired again and again.  
He'd heard about AI,  
Said "worth giving a try,"  
And Mike built him this whole course to explain.

Now the agents are coming to help him,  
They'll scrape the web, right to the brim,  
They'll enrich his leads,  
And meet all his needs,  
While Graham just sips his afternoon swim.

*(Graham: if you don't swim, substitute your leisure activity of choice.  
The rhyme scheme demanded it. Poetry is hard.)*

---

### Learning Objectives
By the end of this module, Graham will be able to:
- [ ] Explain what an "AI agent" is in plain English (to clients, partners, or skeptical family members)
- [ ] Distinguish between a regular AI chatbot and an AI agent that *does things*
- [ ] Understand why AI agents are the upgrade from AI tools like ChatGPT
- [ ] Describe 3 specific things an AI agent could do for a marketing business
- [ ] Feel genuinely excited (not intimidated) about what comes next

---

### Key Concepts to Cover

**1. The Chatbot vs. Agent distinction**  
- Chatbot: You ask a question → it answers → done. Full stop.
- Agent: You give it a goal → it plans → it uses tools → it executes → it reports back → it *remembers* for next time
- The difference is like a calculator vs. an assistant

**2. What "tools" means for an AI agent**  
- Tools are things the AI can DO: browse websites, read files, send messages, run scripts, call APIs
- An agent is only as powerful as its tools
- OpenClaw gives the agent *many* tools — and you can add more

**3. The "loop" — how agents think and act**  
- Perceive → Think → Act → Observe → Repeat
- Unlike a chatbot (one answer), agents loop until the task is done
- This is why they can handle complex, multi-step work

**4. Agentic AI in marketing — the concrete version**</pre>
